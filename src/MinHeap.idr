    Add the element to the bottom level of the heap at the leftmost open space.
    Compare the added element with its parent; if they are in the correct order, stop.
    If not, swap the element with its parent and return to the previous step.

-- I forgot that representing a heap as an array makes this much easier, but after seeing the diagram on Wikipedia it brings back DSA memories
{-
Additionally, a binary heap can be implemented with a traditional binary tree data structure, but there is an issue with finding the adjacent element on the last level on the binary heap when adding an element. This element can be determined algorithmically or by adding extra data to the nodes, called "threading" the treeâ€”instead of merely storing references to the children, we store the inorder successor of the node as well.
